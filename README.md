Usage
  
    To search, you can choose between searching for English words or searching for Vietnamese words. Find the word you want and click the Search button, then the text area below will display the meaning of the word.
    To add a new word, first choose the kind of word you want to add. then type the word in the small text field below and its explaination in the text area, after that, click the Add button.
    To delete a word, first choose the kind of word you want to delete. Then click the Delete button. (Highly recommend you to search for the word first in the large text field before clicking the Delete button)
    To edit a word, first choose the kind of word that you want to edit. Then click the Edit button. (Highly recommend you to search for the word first in the large text field before clicking the Edit button)
    To use the online translate function, first choose what kind of translation you want, from English to Vietnamese or from Vietnamese to English. Then type what you want to be translated in the left window and press the translate button (arrow icon) or Enter. The translated version of what you typed will be displayed in the right window. (Make sure you have the Internet connected)
    Any changes to the data of the dictionary will be AUTO SAVED, so be careful, there is no ctrl + Z for you to use üíÄ.(I don't even know why I make my app like this, but I ran out of time anyway.)
    To pronounce the word, click the Pronounce button (Speaker icon).
    To practice, click the Practice button (Play icon), then the application will display a Game window.
        In the Game window, click the Start button to start the game.
        The application will display a word that is removed some letters, you need to enter the complete version of the word to get a point. (If you wonder why you have to type the whole word instead of removed letters, that is because do it like this will be easier to code. sorry for the inconvenient ‚âßÔπè‚â¶ üôè! . But just think this is just a way to help you develope the skill of quickly typing english word.) 
        If the answer is correct, the application will display a new word and increase the score by 1.
        If the answer is incorrect, the message 'Wrong answer' will be displayed, and you have to provide the correct answer in order for the app to display a new word. (No luck in my game. It's all skill! Don't expect to skip the hard words and then complete the easy ones for points p(‚ï¨ √í ‚Ä∏ √ì)q )
        To end the game, click the End button.
        To play again, click the Re Play again button (Re Play icon).
